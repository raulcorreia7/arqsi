ARQSI Course ISEP. 

In this course you are supposed to develop 3 components:
* ONE REST API in C#: 
    * with a catalog of closets
    * Domain model and validation logic
    * Restrictions:
      * .Net Core 2.1
      * A relational database, Microsoft SQL Server
      * Must use Postman tests
    * Graded 19/20
    
* One REST API in NodeJS: 
  * Orders of closets
  * Consumes C# backend 
  * Restrictions:
    * Uses MongoDB
    * NodeJS
    * No domain logic on this API
    * A relational database, Microsoft SQL Server
  * Graded 21.5/20 (extra points)

* A frontpage in Angular consuming both APIs:
    * Graded 19.95/20

In the root of the repository is: 
  * Each iteration proposed problem and restrictions (portuguese)
  * Each iteration development documentation with various diagrams.
  * Postman testing


Every extra bonus point was achieved in all iterations:

Use software patterns:
* SOLID principle
* Repository pattern

Build proper CRUD
* Test every single crud operation with postman
